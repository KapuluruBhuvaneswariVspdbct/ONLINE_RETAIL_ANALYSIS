# Online Retail Analysis using Python (EDA + RFM + Churn Insights) 🛒📊

This project explores 500,000+ online retail transactions using **Python**, focusing on customer segmentation, retention analysis, and churn insights through **EDA**, **RFM**, and visual storytelling with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## 📌 Key Goals:
- Segment customers using RFM
- Identify churn-prone behavior
- Visualize sales trends and customer engagement
- Recommend targeted retention strategies

## 🔧 Tech Stack:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- PowerPoint for insights presentation
  
## 🔍 Insights Generated
1. 89% of sales come from the UK; other countries contribute marginally  
2. Sales grow consistently and peak in the last quarter of the year  
3. RFM analysis shows many inactive (low recency) customers  
4. Monetary value remains relatively stable across segments  
5. Frequency drops sharply in higher recency groups — potential churn  
6. Customers with RFM scores at extremes (low and high) are balanced — opportunity to shift users toward higher engagement  
7. Histogram & KDE show customers in the 100–350 recency range are likely to churn  
8. Actionable focus should be on mid-recency users to retain and boost frequency
