   - Loaded the dataset from a custom URL (hosted online).

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Filled missing values intelligently.
   - Replaced missing product descriptions using matching stock IDs.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created new columns like `Month` for time-based analysis.
   - Added a `TotalPrice` column (UnitPrice Ã— Quantity).

4. **Visualization**  
   - Monthly sales trends.
   - Top 5 countries by performance.

5. **RFM Analysis**  
   - Performed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary analysis to classify customer behaviors.
